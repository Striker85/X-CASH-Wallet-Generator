# X-CASH-Wallet-Generator
X-CASH Paper Wallet Generator

This page generates a new X-CASH address. It is self contained and does all the necessary calculations locally, so is suitable for generating a new wallet on a machine that is not connected to the network, and may even never be. This way, you can create a X-CASH wallet without risking the keys. The X-CASH Paper Wallet Generator produces all four keys, the public key, the view key, the spend key and the seed. This way you have many options to import the wallet into the CLI or GUI.
